## More Info
This version "hacks in" an A7 payload from ra1npoc and adds the A10X/T2 "do nothing" from the SSHRD\_Script gaster, but it didn't work for me.


(Ignore the arguments/help text, that was another test. Maybe someone else can extend it further, removing the hacks)


If plausible, I will attempt to maybe get it actually working on A7 (or test it with my other A7 device that is nice to linux)
