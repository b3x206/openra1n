# TODO

* [ ] Allow pushing pongo after pwned dfu (external gaster mode)
* [ ] Update the gaster version to the sshrd\_script's version (removing the need for the `-np` argument)
      ^ i feel like the problem is not gaster, but rather the payload for A5 (as gaster also does payloads). i should check the rainpoc15 too maybe.
