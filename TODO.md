For the iPad, ended up downgrading to iOS 10.3.3 and using totally.not.spyware.lol instead.

Here's a list of actual TODO:
* [ ] Attempt to fix the ra1npoc payload (though requires mac os environment or the payloads aren't modifiable `:(`)
* [ ] Test with my other A7 device that bodes well
* [ ] Attempt to backport the gaster modifications to the mac os usb version (though very likely it isn't needed)
